They were looking for a re-design of their existing website which was starting to look dated. Together with Felix, who crated the design which I then coded as a bespoke WordPress theme. As we were hosting and managing the new website for them I created a clean WordPress setup, imported all their blog posts and ensured all content within the site was editable (using Advanced Custom Fields) so it could be easily updated by the client. The client was so happy with the result they've come straight to us to create them a new website for a sub-brand.</p>

Felix designed the new website and I coded it as a bespoke WordPress theme. This was one of the largest sites I'd worked on and was a really challenging ensuring all the content the client wanted was migrated over to the new website.</p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-sm md:text-base text-gray-500">After working on a few freelance projects through the worst of the pandemic I secured a full time role at APP4 in their tech team creating app UI designs that worked with their app framework and creating bespoke websites. They were experiencing rapid growth in customers from the demand for food ordering systems increasing because of the pandemic restrictions bringing problems which I was able to overcome with experience such as quickly implementing a ticketing system to allow the customer support team to priorities tasks they needed the tech team's help for. Having never worked with mobile apps previously I was quick to pick up the knowledge required to debug problems with the Android and Apple app framework they use and how to get the apps from build files to live in the Google Play & Apple App Store. While my WordPress experience made creating the bespoke websites a breeze and enabled me to work on my UI design skills.</p>

But my existing experience allowed me to Identify problems with the companies website and organise meetings to plan improvements to it which I was then responsible for Implementing to improve user experience and increase website conversions. Unfortunately my time at BreifYourMarket was cut very short due to a decision to dramatically cut staff at the start of the covid pandemic. </p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-sm md:text-base text-gray-500">When I started at Adrak my role was to design & code bespoke landing pages that focus on optimised lead generation. These were just HTML/CSS files saved on a shared office drive but I didn't think this was the most efficient way of working so creating a basic custom CMS for location-based landing pages to allow the functionality code to be separate from the visual HTML/CSS code to make it easier to maintain. I also transitioned the team to using GIT version control and automated deployment rather than shared drives and FTP so everyone knew what changes had been made, changes could be put live quickly and easily and then rolled back if needed. My skills were soon noticed by the development departed and I was soon responsible for maintaining bespoke WordPress plugins used across multiple websites. Updating & resolving issues on eccomerce websites and bespoke ordering systems. Resolving issues reported directly by clients and communicating back to them. Supporting the design/front-end team and training junior team members.</p>

Support clients with updating their WordPress and eccomerce websites. Resolve any issues I could or reporting them to the development team. The skills I'd developed from teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS & WordPress allowed me to progress into a junior front end role within 6 months where my role was to code bespoke WordPress websites from scratch to a pre-defined design. Ensure my code is readable, fully responsive, and works in all commonly used browsers. Integrate third-party plugins and a bespoke eccomerce system into WordPress.

The two recent projects we worked together on are DB Wood & Stevenage Glass which have both been great successes and I loved being involved with the projects from start to finish. </p>

Me and my partner Jordan bought our first house at the start of 2020 and just managed to move in before the first lockdown. With lots more spare time stuck in then we imagined I kept myself busy getting into some DIY projects, some going really well and others being, well lets just say learning curves.</p>
