                <p class="pt-3 text-sm md:text-base">After working on few freelance projects through the worse of the pandemic I secured a full time role at APP4 in their tech team creating app UI designs that worked with their app framework and creating bespoke websites. Due to the rapid growth caused by the demand for food ordering systems caused by the pandemic it was a very fast paced job and I was able to quickly implement a ticketing system to allow the customer support team to prioritise tasks they needed the tech team's help for. Having never worked with mobile apps previously I was quick to pick up the knowledge required to debug problems with the Andoid and Apple app framework they use and how to get the apps from build files to live in the Google Play & Apple App Store.</p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-sm md:text-base">At my time at BreifYourMarket the majority of my work was designing & coding bespoke email templates & print marketing for a wide range of clients. But my existing experience allowed me to Identify problems with the companies website and organisie meetings to plan improvements to it which I was then responsible for Implementing to improve user experience and increase website conversions. Unfortunately my time at BreifYourMarket was cut very short due to a decision to dramatically cut staff at the start of the covid pandemic. </p>

                <p class="uppercase md:text-lg">Sep 2017 to Dec 2019 at Adtrak<br>Front End Developer, UX/UI Designer & PHP Back End Developer</p>
                <p class="pt-3 text-sm md:text-base">When I started at Adrak my role was to design & code bespoke landing pages that focus on optimised lead generation. These were just HTML/CSS files saved on a shared office drive but I didn't think this was the most efficient way of working so creating a basic custom CMS for location-based landing pages to allow the functionality code to be separate from the visual HTML/CSS code to make it easier to maintain. I also transitioned the team to using GIT version control and automated deployment rather than shared drives and FTP so everyone knew what changes had been made, changes could be put live quickly and easily and then rolled back if needed. My skills were soon noticed by the development departed and I was soon responsible for maintaining bespoke WordPress plugins used across multiple websites. Updating & resolving issues on eccomerce websites and bespoke ordering systems. Resolving issues reported directly by clients and communicating back to them. Supporting the design/front-end team and training junior team members.</p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-sm md:text-base">My first agency job was client support apprentice at Purpose Media where my job was to communicate directly with clients over the phone, through support tickets and emails. Support clients with updating their WordPress and eccomerce websites. Resolve any issues I could or reporting them to the development team. The skills I'd developed from teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS & WordPress allowed my to progress into a junior front end role within 6 months where my role was to code bespoke WordPress websites from scratch to a pre-defined design. Ensure my code is readable, fully responsive, and works in all commonly used browsers. Integrate third-party plugins and a bespoke eccomerce system into WordPress. Supporting the client support team with website issues.</p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-sm md:text-base">I've worked on a wide variety of freelance projects in my spare time, starting with family friends while I was still learning the basics to currently working on joint projects with two friends who I'd worked with at a previous agency. The two recent projects we worked together on are DB Wood & Stevenage Glass which have both been great successes and I loved being involved with the projects from start to finish. </p>

            <p class="pt-8 max-w-xl">When I'm not glued to a computer screen I'll most likely be out walking with the other half, living so close to the peak district means we're never short of a somewhere to walk or spending time with family on the Suffolk coast. More recently the majority of my spare time has been spent doing endless DIY projects after recently buying our first house together.</p>
