                <p>I’ve been making websites for the last 5 years and have over 3 and a half years of experience working in both a small and large digital agency in a variety of different roles. I’ve worked on projects for clients all over the country, covering a wide range of sectors, designing and coding bespoke WordPress websites, ecommerce websites and lead generating landing pages.</p>
                <p>My passion for the web started while studying IT at college when I started to teach myself the basics of HTML and CSS. I then went onto getting to grips with WordPress and using it to create simple websites for family friends and a few local businesses. Torn between going to university or not I decided to go for a digital agency apprenticeship and my existing skills gave me a massive advantage, enabling me to secure a full-time role in the team and progress on from there.</p>
                <p>By working in different roles I have been able to build up valuable knowledge of all aspects from UI design and UX considerations, front and back end development and SEO and PPC optimisations.</p>
                <p>When I’m not working, I spend a lot of time traveling and exploring new places while taking lots of photos along the way. I’m lucky to have the Peak District right on my doorstep, family that live on the east coast and family that have a chalet in the French Alps so I’m never short of new places to explore. You can see a few photos I’ve taken recently below.</p>

                <p>I always take every opportunity to further develop and learn valuable new skills. I enjoy looking into the latest trends and new technologies and love challenging myself. I’m currently learning Vue.js & React in my spare time.</p>
                <p>I would describe myself as a very friendly, open person that can get on with everyone and work well in a team. I’m passionate about seeing projects through from start to finish and aim to always go beyond expectations.</p>
                <p>I’ve always been fascinated by technology and spent hours building computers in my childhood bedroom, I even set up an eBay store selling parts I’d salvaged from old and broken electronics.</p>
